#The Event Management System is a simple web-based application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend and PHP with MySQL for the backend. It provides a platform for creating, managing, and attending events online. The application allows administrators to add, update, and delete events, while users can view event details, register for events, and track their participation. HTML and CSS ensure a clean and responsive interface, JavaScript adds interactivity such as form validation and dynamic event listings, and PHP handles server-side operations like user authentication and event management. MySQL stores all user and event data securely, enabling efficient data retrieval and updates. This project demonstrates the integration of basic web technologies to deliver a functional and user-friendly event management solution.
